# CRUDOperations

## Overview

This project is a .NET Core Web API that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing products. It follows a three-tier architecture with Controller, Service, and Data Access layers. The project is also integrated with Swagger for API documentation.

### Project Structure

- **Controller Layer**: This layer handles HTTP requests and responses. It contains endpoints for CRUD operations.
  
- **Services Layer**: The service layer contains the business logic of the application. It communicates with the data access layer for data operations.

- **Data Access Layer**: This layer is responsible for interacting with the database. It provides data access and manipulation functions.

### Prerequisites

- .NET Core SDK
- MySQL Server
- Visual Studio or another code editor of your choice
- [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore) for Swagger integration
- [APIException](#apiexception-library) library

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.

3. Change Connection string from AppSettings.Json

4. Build and run the application.

5. Access the Swagger documentation for the API at `https://yourdomain/swagger` to explore the available endpoints and their descriptions.

## ExcepitionMidLib Library

The project utilizes a custom lib which develop by me `ExcepitionMidLib` library for handling global exceptions and maintaining global response. This library is used to generate standardized responses for successful and error scenarios.

### Response

An error response includes the following fields:

- `trackingid`: A unique identifier for tracking the error.
- `usermessage`: A user-friendly error message.
- `developerMessage`: A developer-specific error message.
- `data`: Additional data related to the error.
- `statuscode`: The HTTP status code indicating the type of error.

Example Error Response:

```json
{
  "trackingid": "ea9e0805-f615-486c-913a-13c09baa30fe",
  "usermessage": "Product is not exists.",
  "developerMessage": null,
  "data": null,
  "statuscode": 406
}
```
Successful Response

```json
{
  "trackingId": "85fef669-292f-4dbb-8f2c-888e8fc88cbd",
  "userMessage": null,
  "developerMessage": null,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "productname": "Mango",
